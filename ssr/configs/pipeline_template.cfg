# === USAGE ===
# Everything that follows a "#" symbol is treated as a comment.
# File and directory paths are denote with
#   "_fp" (file path) and
#   "_dp" # (directory path).
# The paths MUST NOT contain any quotation marks.
# Boolean variables (such as "reconstruct_sfm_mvs" or "extract_pan") can be
# toggled with "1" and "0" or "True" and "False".
